## Personalize this README

1. Replace placeholder links (project repos, website, social links) with real URLs.
2. Add screenshots for projects by creating an `assets/` folder and referencing images like `![screenshot](assets/example.png)`.
3. If you want a specific layout (portfolio grid, academic CV, or minimal), tell me and I can adapt this file and add a small template for projects.

*Updated: polished profile README with your details. Commit & push will make this live on your profile.*
